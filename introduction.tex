\section{Introduction}
Boost converters are widely used in numerous electrical applications throughout the world, all the way from small battery powered applications to hybrid electric vehicles. Its frequent use makes it impossible to ignore and very important to understand. But understanding the boost converter is worthless if you cannot make one yourself.\

The subject of this report is the procedure of designing and producing a printed ciruit board (PCB) step up converter with the constraint of using a 1mH inducotor.\
This report will explore the procedures required for developing such a PCB.\ 
The goal of the project was to successfully design and produce a step up converter using the tools at hand, but also to get the understanding of some of the difficulties one can encounter in the process.\

Before this project we knew how a boost converter worked in theory and had a small amount of experience of how it worked in practice. We knew how to design and simulate circuits using Multisim but had no experience of producing PCB's.\

When the circuits' design had been made, components chosen, and simulations had been performed, we knew what to expect from the final outcome. The simulated output voltage of the circuit at 10000Hz and a duty cycle of 0.9 was 15V. This value will be compared to the actual output voltage of the circuit to evaluate if the project was a success or not.\
