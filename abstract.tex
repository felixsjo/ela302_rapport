\section{Abstract}
\textbf{Boost converters is an important tool for many aplications including many small battery powered devices and hybrid electric vehicles. And for the engineer its function is of great importance. But so is it to be able to make one. This report explores the design and production of making a boost converter on a printed circuit board with the purpose to supply the reader with information about the experience that was gained doing this project. This includes what hardware and software was used, the choice of components, the manufactoring process and how the circuit finally got tested. The goal of the project was to successfully produce a working boost converter which actual measured voltage output is in pair with the simulated value. This is found to not be the case, possibly because of an unwanted short in the circuit.}
