\section{Software}
Accompaning the earlier note on replicability, a similar description of suitable software substitutes will be provided, since the software choices relies heavily on the hardware used.\quad The only crucial software, if a setup similar to what was described above was to be used, would be the IDE used to program the Arduino board. One option is the official Arduino IDE, available as a web-based editor and as a desktop application\cite{arduino}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multisim\cite{multisim}, by National Instruments, was used to design and simulate the circuit, a software based environment allows for fast and easy experimentation, which is convenient in electronics design due to its trial-and-error nature.
    \item Ultiboard is another peice of software by National Instruments, with out-of-the-box integration with Multisim. It was used to design the actual PCB using the already-designed circuit from Multisim.
    \item Voltera for Windows 64-bit was used to interact with the Voltera printer.
\end{itemize}
