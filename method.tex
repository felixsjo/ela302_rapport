\subsection{Problem formulation}
ja det verkar som att problemformuleringen ska vara h√§r
\textit{The problm formulation is defined upon hypothesis to define the problem or problems for the thesis}
\textit{How will you test the hypothesis? What methods will be used from the knowledge learned in state of the art?}
\\The PCB was tested using the National Instruments myDAQ, by powering the PCB with the myDAQ:s constant 5V output and then imposing a square wave on the input pin with following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
        \item Constant 5V amplitude.
        \item Constant 2.5V positive offset.
        \item Variable frequency $100Hz-10kHz$
        \item Variable duty-cycle $10\% - 90\%$
\end{itemize}
The voltage across GND and Output was measured whilst modifying the variables above, see \ref{fig:pcb} for more details.
