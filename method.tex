\section{Method}
\textit{How will you test the hypothesis? What methods will be used from the knowledge learned in state of the art?}
\\The PCB was tested using the National Instruments \textit{myDAQ}, by imposing a square wave with following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
        \item Constant 5V amplitude.
        \item Constant 2.5V positive offset.
        \item Variable frequency $100Hz-10kHz$
        \item Variable duty-cycle $10\% - 90\%$
\end{itemize}
and then measuring the output
