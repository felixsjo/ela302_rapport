\section{Choice of components}
The choice of componets was experimentally produced though the starting point were an erlier lab where a working boost converter was already designed. This design was of course not directly applicable to our project since this was not a surface mounted design. Different components were tested and simulated untill a desireble result was reached, see Tab~\ref{tab:comp}. Simulations were done using a $50\Omega$ resistor in series before the inductor to simulate a real inductor, which has a resistance. While small components often are desireble, the size can compromie circuit stability, espesially regarding capacitors. Therefore a smaller capacitor was not necessary.
